        "consequences": "Skipping rotations causes uneven tread wear, which reduces grip and handling, can trigger vibrations at highway speeds, and may force you to replace tires thousands of miles sooner than necessary."

        "why": "Transmission fluid degrades from heat and friction over time, losing its ability to lubricate gears and maintain hydraulic pressure. At {{mileage}} miles, fresh fluid helps your transmission shift smoothly and stay cool.",
        "consequences": "Old, degraded transmission fluid causes rough or delayed shifting, overheating, and accelerated wear on internal gears and clutch packs. Transmission repairs or replacement typically cost $3,000–$6,000 — making fluid changes one of the best-value preventive services."

        "why": "Brake fluid absorbs moisture from the air over time, which lowers its boiling point and can cause spongy brakes or brake fade during heavy use. At {{mileage}} miles, a fluid flush restores full braking confidence.",
        "consequences": "Moisture-contaminated brake fluid can boil during hard braking (like going down a hill), causing temporary loss of braking power. It also corrodes internal brake components from the inside, leading to caliper and line failures."

        "consequences": "Old coolant can cause internal corrosion that damages the radiator, water pump, heater core, and head gasket. Overheating from coolant failure can warp the cylinder head — a repair that often costs $1,500–$3,000."

        "why": "Spark plugs wear down over thousands of ignition cycles, causing weaker sparks that reduce power, fuel economy, and emissions performance. At {{mileage}} miles, fresh plugs restore crisp throttle response and smooth idling.",
        "consequences": "Worn spark plugs cause misfires, rough idling, poor acceleration, increased fuel consumption, and can damage the catalytic converter — a component that costs $1,000–$2,500 to replace."

        "why": "Wiper blades are made of rubber that degrades from UV exposure, heat, and use. After about 6–12 months, the rubber loses flexibility and begins to streak, skip, or smear — reducing visibility during rain.",

        "why": "Front brakes do 60–70% of the stopping work on most vehicles. At {{mileage}} miles, if your pads are worn below safe thickness, replacing them restores full braking power and protects the more expensive rotors.",
        "consequences": "Driving on worn brake pads causes metal-to-metal contact with the rotors, creating a grinding noise, dramatically increasing stopping distance, and turning a pad-only job into a pads-and-rotors replacement at 2–3x the cost."

        "why": "While rear brakes handle less force than the fronts, they're essential for balanced stopping and stability. At {{mileage}} miles, replacing worn rear pads maintains even braking and prevents damage to rear rotors.",

        "why": "Suspension components wear gradually, so you may not notice the decline in handling and ride quality. At {{mileage}} miles, an inspection catches worn parts before they cause tire wear, alignment issues, or unsafe handling.",
